### Hi there\! 👋🏽

[cite_start]I'm a **Master's Student in Computer Science** at the University of Freiburg, specialising in **Artificial Intelligence**[cite: 7, 10].

Here’s a snapshot of what I do, love, and live by:

#### 🛠️ Technical Skills:

  - **Languages**: Python, C++, C, JavaScript, SQL.
  - **AI & ML Frameworks**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, LangChain, Hugging Face, MONAI.
  - **Cloud & Ops**: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS (SageMaker), Azure, MLFlow.

#### 💼 Professional Experience:

  - **Machine Learning Intern at Wizdom Ed**: Engineered a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline using LangChain to reduce hallucinations.
      - 📈 Achieved a **35% increase** in student engagement by optimizing data ingestion workflows.
      - 🚀 Drove a **25% improvement** in learning outcomes and a **30% boost** in positive response rates through retrieval quality feedback loops.

#### 🧠 Key Projects:

  - **UNETR 3D Abdomen Segmentation**: Architected a volumetric segmentation pipeline using Vision Transformers (UNETR) on the BTCV dataset.
      - Achieved a **0.8027 Mean Dice Score** for 13 distinct organs using compound Dice-Cross Entropy loss.
  - **Neural Machine Translation**: Developed a Transformer-based NMT model for English-Hindi translation.
      - Reached a **SacreBLEU score of 62.48** and reduced Character Error Rate (CER) to 0.28.
